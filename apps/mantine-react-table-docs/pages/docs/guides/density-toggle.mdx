## Density Toggle Feature Guide

Mantine React Table includes a density toggle button in the top toolbar by default where a user can toggle between 3 different density levels. This is a great feature to include to help with accessibility for different user preferences, but it can easily be disabled if it is not wanted.

### Relevant Table Options

<TableOptionsTable
  onlyOptions={new Set(['enableDensityToggle', 'onDensityChange'])}
/>

### Relevant State

<StateOptionsTable onlyOptions={new Set(['density'])} />

### Default Density

By default, Mantine React Table will render with a medium `md` density.

A density toggle is shown by default to let a user change the density to cycle through `xl`, `md`, and `xs` densities.

> When a `xs` density is set, whitespace is set to `nowrap` by default to keep the rows as short in height as possible. This can be overridden in the `mantineTableBodyCellProps` styles or sx prop.

#### Change Default Density

If you want to change the default density, you can set that in either the `initialState` or `state` table option.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  data,
  columns,
  initialState: { density: 'xs' },
});
```

### Disable or Hide the Density Toggle

You can change the default density, and disable the density toggle itself if you want.

In this example, the density toggle is disabled and a `xs` density is set by default in the `initialState` prop.
