## Pagination Feature Guide

Client-side pagination is enabled by default in Mantine React Table. There are a number of ways to customize pagination, turn off pagination, or completely replace the built in pagination with your own manual or server-side pagination logic.

### Relevant Table Options

<TableOptionsTable
  onlyOptions={
    new Set([
      'autoResetPageIndex',
      'enablePagination',
      'getPaginationRowModel',
      'mantinePaginationProps',
      'manualPagination',
      'onPaginationChange',
      'pageCount',
      'paginateExpandedRows',
      'paginationDisplayMode',
      'positionPagination',
      'rowCount',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant State Options

<StateOptionsTable onlyOptions={new Set(['pagination'])} />

### Disable Pagination

If you simply want to disable pagination, you can set the `enablePagination` table option to `false`. This will both hide the pagination controls and disable the pagination functionality.

If you only want to disable the pagination logic, but still want to show and use the pagination controls, take a look down below at the [Manual Pagination](##manual-or-server-side-pagination) docs.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  enablePagination: false,
  enableBottomToolbar: false, //hide the bottom toolbar as well if you want
});
```

### Customize Pagination

#### Customize Pagination Behavior

There are a few table options that you can use to customize the pagination behavior. The first one is `autoResetPageIndex`. This table option is `true` by default, and causes a table to automatically reset the table back to the first page whenever sorting, filtering, or grouping occurs. This makes sense for most use cases, but if you want to disable this behavior, you can set this table option to `false`.

Next there is `paginateExpandedRows`, which works in conjunction expanding features. This table option is `true` by default, and forces the table to still only render the same number of rows per page that is set as the page size, even as sub-rows become expanded. However, this does cause expanded rows to sometimes not be on the same page as their parent row, so you can turn this off to keep sub rows with their parent row on the same page.

#### Customize Pagination Components

You can customize the pagination component with the `mantinePaginationProps` table option to change things like the `rowsPerPageOptions` or whether or not to show the first and last page buttons, and more.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  mantinePaginationProps: {
    rowsPerPageOptions: ['5', '10'],
    withEdges: false, //note: changed from `showFirstLastButtons` in v1.0
  },
});
```

#### Alternate Pagination UI

By default, Mantine React Table provides its own Table Pagination UI that is more compact and traditional for data tables. However, if you want to use the Mantine Pagination component instead, it is as easy as setting the `paginationDisplayMode` table option to `pages`.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  paginationDisplayMode: 'pages',
});
```

<AlternatePaginationExample />

### Manual or Server-Side Pagination

#### Manual Pagination

The default pagination features are client-side. This means you have to have all of your data fetched and stored in the table all at once. This may not be ideal for large datasets, but do not worry, Mantine React Table supports server-side pagination.

When the `manualPagination` table option is set to `true`, Mantine React Table will assume that the `data` that is passed to the table already has had the pagination logic applied. Usually you would do this in your back-end logic.

#### Override Page Count and Row Count

If you are using manual pagination, the default page count and row count in the MRT Pagination component will be incorrect, as it is only derived from the number of rows provided in the client-side `data` table option. Luckily, you can override these values and set your own page count or row count in the `pageCount` and `rowCount` table options.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  manualPagination: true,
  rowCount: data.meta.totalDBRowCount, //you can tell the pagination how many rows there are in your back-end data
});
```

### Manage Pagination State

For either client-side or server-side pagination, you may want to have access to the pagination state yourself. You can do this like so with `state`:

```jsx
//store pagination state in your own state
const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({
  pageIndex: 0,
  pageSize: 5, //customize the default page size
});

useEffect(() => {
  //do something when the pagination state changes
}, [pagination.pageIndex, pagination.pageSize]);

const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  onPaginationChange: setPagination, //hoist pagination state to your state when it changes internally
  state: { pagination }, //pass the pagination state to the table
});

return <MantineReactTable table={table} />;
```

Alternatively, if all you care about is customizing the initial pagination state and do not need to react to its changes, like customizing the default page size or the page index, you can do that like so with `initialState`:

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  initialState: { pagination: { pageSize: 25, pageIndex: 2 } },
});
```
