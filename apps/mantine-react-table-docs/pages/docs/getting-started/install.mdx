## Installation

> `mantine-react-table-open` V8 requires **Mantine V8.0.0+** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Mantine, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mantine/core` (^v7.3+)
> 2.  `@mantine/hooks` (^v7.3+)
> 3.  `@mantine/dates` (^v7.3+)
> 4.  `@tabler/icons-react` (2.23.0+)
> 5.  `dayjs` (v1.11+)
> 6.  `clsx` (v2+)
> 7.  `react` and `react-dom` (v18)

### Quick Install

The Quick Install instructions here assume you already have Mantine V8 installed and correctly configured with postcss in your project.

<InstallCommand packagesString="mantine-react-table-open@beta" />

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

It is best to refer to the [Mantine V8 installation guide](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) for the most up-to-date instructions on how to install Mantine V8 for your specific React meta framework. (Next.js, Remix, Vite, etc.)

#### Install Mantine React Table with Mantine required peer dependencies:

<InstallCommand />
<br />

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `mantine-react-table-open`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`

#### Install PostCSS dev dependencies (Optional)

If you are using Mantine V8, it is common to use CSS modules for advanced custom styling. You may want to install and configure PostCSS like down below, but it is not required if you are using a different styling solution.

<InstallCommand packagesString="-D postcss postcss-preset-mantine postcss-simple-vars" />
<br />

Create a `postcss.config.cjs` file in the root of your project with the following contents:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {},
    'postcss-simple-vars': {
      variables: {
        'mantine-breakpoint-xs': '36em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-sm': '48em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-md': '62em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-lg': '75em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-xl': '88em',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

<br />

### Setup Mantine Theme

The [Mantine V8 installation guide](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) has much better instructions for how to set up your Mantine theme, but you should have something like this in your project:

```tsx
import { MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  /** Put your mantine theme override here */
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

### Import CSS Styles

After you install mantine-react-table-open, you will need to import the CSS styles from `mantine-react-table-open/styles.css` at the root of your project. (Where you import your other Mantine CSS styles.)

```js
import '@mantine/core/styles.layer.css'; //import Mantine V8 styles needed by MRT
import '@mantine/dates/styles.layer.css'; //if using Mantine date picker features
import 'mantine-react-table-open/styles.css'; //import MRT styles
```

### Common Errors

If you don't see any styles applied to the mantine table components, you may have mismatching versions of `mantine-react-table-open` and `@mantine/core`. MRT v1 requires Mantine v6 and will not work with Mantine v8. MRT v8 will be released by the end of 2023 and will work with Mantine v8.

Also, if the Action Icon Buttons all have a filled color, that is a good sign that you simply forgot to import the MRT CSS file in the step above.

If you get an error like this:

```bash
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You probably do not have the correct version of Mantine or Tabler Icons installed.

Make sure all mantine packages are at least v8.0.0.

Make sure that the `@tabler/icons-react` package is at least v2.23.0.

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bash
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.
