## PDF Export Example

Mantine React Table does not have a data exporting feature built-in. However, you can easily integrate your own exporting features.

In the example below, `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` are connected to some export buttons in the top toolbar to export table rows to a PDF file that can be downloaded.
