## Editing (CRUD) Inline Row Example

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality can be easily implemented with Mantine React Table, with a combination of editing, toolbar, and row action features.

This example below uses the inline [`"row"`](/docs/guides/editing#row-editing-mode) editing mode, which allows you to edit a single row at a time with built-in save and cancel buttons.

Check out the other editing modes down below, and the [editing guide](/docs/guides/editing) for more information.
