## Editing (CRUD) Example

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality can be easily implemented with Mantine React Table, with a combination of editing, toolbar, and row action features.

This example below uses the default [`"modal"`](/docs/guides/editing#modal-editing-mode) editing mode, where a dialog opens up to edit 1 row at a time.

Check out the other editing modes down below, and the [editing guide](/docs/guides/editing) for more information.
