## Editing (CRUD) Inline Table Example

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality can be easily implemented with Mantine React Table, with a combination of editing, toolbar, and row action features.

This example below uses the inline [`"table"`](/docs/guides/editing#row-editing-mode) editing mode, which allows you to edit a single cell at a time, but all rows are always in an open editing state. Hook up your own event listeners to save the data to your backend.

Check out the other editing modes down below, and the [editing guide](/docs/guides/editing) for more information.
